# CSCI 3308 Group 4 - Team PowerPlay

## Mission Statement
Power Play is a web-based sports trading card game where users collect, trade, and battle using digital cards based on real NBA and WNBA athletes. Each card includes real-world performance statistics—such as points, assists, and rebounds—that directly influence gameplay mechanics like attack, defense, and health. Players build custom decks of five cards and compete in round-based matches, with outcomes determined by a combination of strategy, deck strength, and optional dice rolls. The game blends sports fandom with tactical gameplay and RPG-style progression.
